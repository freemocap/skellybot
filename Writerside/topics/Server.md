# Server

Aka a `guild` in the Discord ontology

A [User] may join multiple servers

Its children are either:
- [Categories](Category.md)
- Category-less [Channel](Channel.md)
- We could consider disallowing category-less channels to make the ontology cleaner
- Category-less [ForumChannel](ForumChannel.md)
