# Thread🌿

This is where a [Chat](Chat.md) happens - This is a base-level datatype, even though it is technically composed of
smaller atomic units (called [Couplet](Couplet.md)s)

Kinda like how a bunch of grapes is teh output of a grapevine, even though it comprises a bunch of individual grapes 🍇

A Thread is composed of a set of linked [Couplets](Couplet.md)
