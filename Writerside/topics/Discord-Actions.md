# Discord Actions

## 🌐👆 - Discord Interactions
Basic actions of the discord ecosystem. 

- 🗨️ - `send messages` -- obviously, most commonly used for communication with `humans`. Here, you'll also use `messages` as:
  - 🔮 - `chat prompts` for the AI
  - 📄 - composing `documents`
    - Use `multi-line editing` by using `shift` + `enter`. This prevents you from SENDING the message until you're done editing it. Super useful!

- 🔔 - `notify` people (with 📱`push-notifications` and 🔴`unread badges`) of one of your messages to get their attention. Two methods: 
  - @ `tag` the `@person` or `@role`, e.g. <@147081024784826369>, <@&1197593935401467971> 
  - 📩 `reply` to one of that person's messages
  - use **responsibly**, don't annoy people. This server is `asynchronous`, so expect replies organically. 

- 📝 - `edit` -- you can edit a `message` you sent using the ✏️ icon when you hover, or `right-clicking`. 
  - This is a primary tool for you here, since remember: your `messages` are also `markdown documents`, and sometimes it's best to have such documents in a stable location. 
  - You can also 🧨 `delete` messages, which is fine, but just be careful. there's pretty much unlimited room here, can always start a new message. 

- 📎 - `attach` -- you can attach most any file to a message, `images`, `audio`, `text files`, `code files`, etc. 
  - 🖼️ - `images` -- you can `copy-paste` an image or screengrab, or `drag` an image file in
  - 🎙️ - `audio` -- on `mobile`, you can record audio directly, on desktop you have to drag/paste a pre-recorded audio file

- 🔎 - `search` -- at the top of discord is a `search` bar. This can search the **entire server**, and is fairly robust. 
  - If you lose track of something, this is your go-to. 

- 🔗 - `linking`-- you can right click any `message`, `channel`, or `thread` to get its `discord address`: 
  - it will look long and ugly like `https://discord.com/channels/1197593935401467964/1203425739924578314/1203427002342834286`
  - but when you send it, it converts to https://discord.com/channels/1197593935401467964/1203425739924578314/1203427002342834286  - EXTREMELY useful when pointing something out, connecting concepts, "turning in" work for me to look at, etc

- 😀 - `emoji react`-- communicate sub-verbal vibes with emoji reacts
  - but this is ALSO used to toggle `#bot-instructions` on and off (using the 🤖 emoji) 

- 📌 - `pin` important messages for a channel or thread by `right clicking` and selecting to `pin` it. 
  - then it will be available in that channel's `pinned messages` (see top-right area, next to the search bar, for the 📌 icon)

- 📁 - `collapse categories` - you can click a category to collapse it and minimize its presence in the vertical scroll of the server. 
  - `collapse all` by `right clicking` a category and selecting it.
