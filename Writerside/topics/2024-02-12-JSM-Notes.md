### User Stories for SkellyBot Software

#### Nightly Tasks

- Configure cron jobs to:
    - Send messages to users
    - Extract data from a server
    - Process stored data
- Configurable via DMs or as an embed in the server

#### Vector Store Memory

- Add vector store memory to the bot
- Set context as part of chat functionality configuration

#### Data Analysis Jobs

- Analyze gathered data from the server
- Summarize chats and extract tags
- Attach analyses to cron jobs

#### Data-Based Messaging

- Send messages based on data from the server
- Run analysis on user data and send reports
- Set message duration and frequency through backend or config file system

### Developer Perspective on User Stories

#### Nightly Tasks Implementation

- Implement a cron job module in the core process
    - Trigger independently of any interface
- Configuration through Discord
    - Use slash commands or message context commands
    - Accept configuration files in JSON or YAML format
    - Utilize Discord attachment handler for file loading
- Cron job module to create and track jobs
    - Ensure triggering at correct intervals

#### Vector Store Memory Development

##### Processing Step

- Message processing through AI module for:
    - Tag extraction
    - Summarization
    - Vector embedding
- Core database models to include:
    - Tags
    - Summaries
    - Embeddings

##### Database Integration

- Processing assumed to be part of database entry route
- Option to trigger processing on the entire database

##### AI Data Extraction

- Extract AI data from messages upon changes
- Options for reprocessing:
    - Immediate for each change
    - Incremental updates
    - Utilizing local models for cost efficiency

##### Retrieval Augmented Generation

- Set up retrievers as AI tools
- Use large language models to:
    - Determine context relevance
    - Generate queries from inputs
- Stuff retrieved data into chat context
- Track metadata of extracted documents
- Include sources in the response to users
- Attach retrieval reports to messages in a presentable format

##### Data Analysis Jobs and Database Messaging

- Sending processed data to users, channels, or servers

###### Types of Analyses

- Volume and structure analyses:
    - Counting messages, characters, tokens, chats, channels, servers
- Natural language processing tasks:
    - Summarizing chats
    - Extracting tags
    - Vector store embeddings
    - Running prompts for data processing

##### Summarization and Tag Extraction

- Raw summarization
- Simple analysis tasks with basic prompts

##### Analyses Requiring Additional Documents

- Analyses dependent on external references
- Example: Cron job sending feedback to a student based on rubric progress
    - Evaluate student's conversation and assignment data
    - Message students about their progress, plan adjustments, or action changes
