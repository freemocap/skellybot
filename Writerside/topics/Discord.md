# Discord

A Chat/Server interface - The primary focus of SkellyBot for now, because:

- Jon uses discord to run his Class/Lab/FreeMoCap community server, so we need to target this functionality first
- Previous incarnation [JonBot](JonBot.md) was built on Discord, so easiest port of concepts

Its children are [Servers](Server.md)
